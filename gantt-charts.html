			<p class="weekly-description">During this first week we all sat down and looked through the breakdown diagram and 
			allocation table. Using this paired with the assessment document, we were able to define what the dependencies 
			were and the order in which it seemed best and most efficient to do things.</p>

			<p class="weekly-description">This week we talked about our progress, and re-evaluated the dependencies of 
			our allocated tasks. Through this, we decided that the diagrammatic representations would be 
			better to be made alongside the code in case the code structure were to change, then those team members 
			would talk amongst themselves to make sure they are accurate.
			The progress of the project as a whole is represented through the shading of the gantt chart.</p>

            <p class="weekly-description">This week was simply a check in for everyone to see where we were at with our allocated 
                tasks, and this progress was represented through the shading on the progress bar. In terms of the outlining 
                methods and approach, now that we have developed further into the project, it should be written with more ease and 
                efficiency. Overall everything looks like it will be finished on target ready to be proofread before submission.</p>

            <p class="weekly-description">We got all the individual components ready for Tuesday so we could sit down and 
                proofread and potentially submit. The deadline for website updates was also changed to the potential new 
                submission date to keep in line with the rest of the work done.
                <br><br>
                These gantt charts were made every Thursday for the week except for the last which  was made on the Tuesday 
                before the submission deadline date. And the groups overall progress is represented by the steady shading of 
                the separate tasks.</p>

            <p class="weekly-description">Wefelt that the most important thing to do first was to go over the code we inherited from the other team,
                and write documentation for it, as it had none. We had to ensure that we knew how the code functioned
                as we moved forward into implementation. Afterwards, we decided our workflow into 2 groups,
                implementation and documentation. We wanted to start off our implementation work by making unit tests
                and then follow on with completing the part 1 requirements not implemented by the other team. Then we
                would move onto part 2 requirements and user evaluation, so that we could implement any changes
                suggested by users. Simultaneously, we would begin work on updating the other teams’ part 1
                deliverables, writing up our progress in the change report. Then to finish off we would work on writing up
                our continuous integration and implementation deliverables, and then uploading all updated files to the
                website. We put our deadline 3 days ahead of the actual deadline to ensure that we had additional time if
                we needed it</p>

            <p class="weekly-description">Upon working through the project, we had taken a bit longer than expected on our software testing due
                to some issues with getting it set up, and we also took longer than expected on part 1 implementation
                (due to us being busy with software testing), and on parts of the change report. Due to this, and due to
                re-evaluating how long other aspects of the project would take, we shortened our deadlines on future
                aspects of the project, such as part 2 implementation and the implementation write up. We had already
                given ourselves lots of extra time for the change report, so it was easy to just push that back a bit</p>

            <p class="weekly-description">As the change report, user evaluation and implementation part 2 was taking longer than expected,
                mainly due to higher time demands of other uni work, we had to push back our deadline a bit to the 21st,
                extending times for the sections affected. To compensate, we shortened the time we had to work on the
                website, as we didn’t think it would take that long, and we also decided to start working on the
                continuous integration write up earlier, simultaneously with the architecture write up, as we had allocated
                it to different people.</p>
