			<p class="weekly-description">During this first week we all sat down and looked through the breakdown diagram and 
			allocation table. Using this paired with the assessment document, we were able to define what the dependencies 
			were and the order in which it seemed best and most efficient to do things.</p>

			<p class="weekly-description">This week we talked about our progress, and re-evaluated the dependencies of 
			our allocated tasks. Through this, we decided that the diagrammatic representations would be 
			better to be made alongside the code in case the code structure were to change, then those team members 
			would talk amongst themselves to make sure they are accurate.
			The progress of the project as a whole is represented through the shading of the gantt chart.</p>

            <p class="weekly-description">This week was simply a check in for everyone to see where we were at with our allocated 
                tasks, and this progress was represented through the shading on the progress bar. In terms of the outlining 
                methods and approach, now that we have developed further into the project, it should be written with more ease and 
                efficiency. Overall everything looks like it will be finished on target ready to be proofread before submission.</p>

            <p class="weekly-description">We got all the individual components ready for Tuesday so we could sit down and 
                proofread and potentially submit. The deadline for website updates was also changed to the potential new 
                submission date to keep in line with the rest of the work done.
                <br><br>
                These gantt charts were made every Thursday for the week except for the last which  was made on the Tuesday 
                before the submission deadline date. And the groups overall progress is represented by the steady shading of 
                the separate tasks.</p>
