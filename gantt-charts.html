			<p class="weekly-description">During this first week we all sat down and looked through the breakdown diagram and 
			allocation table. Using this paired with the assessment document, we were able to define what the dependencies 
			were and the order in which it seemed best and most efficient to do things.</p>

			<p class="weekly-description">This week we talked about our progress, and re-evaluated the dependencies of 
			our allocated tasks. Through this, we decided that the diagrammatic representations would be 
			better to be made alongside the code in case the code structure were to change, then those team members 
			would talk amongst themselves to make sure they are accurate.
			The progress of the project as a whole is represented through the shading of the gantt chart.</p>
